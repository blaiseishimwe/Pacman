Pacman Coding Activity

To run this activity, clone the pacman repository and load the index file in your browser.
In this coding activity, I create pacmen and make them move across the screen.
pacmen are created on demand by clicking the "add pacman" button. To move the pacmen,
click on the "start game" button.
When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new pacman appears at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the pacman or pacmen created start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it changes direction to stay within the frame of the web page.
This was achieved by using conditionals and switching velocities whenever a pacman hits the edge.
In the future, I want to switch images whenever a pacman hits the edge and to have them change directions whenever they collide.
